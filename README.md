# Movies-ETL

Used Jupyter Notebook and PGAdmin to clean datasets, merge them, and create DataFrames.
Exported merged DataFrame to SQL database.

Queried row counts for tables and they were both incorrect. I have run out of time to continue tracking down the errors in my code, but i have submitted all deliverables as well as the Resources folder containing the Query statements and the (incorrect) counts.
